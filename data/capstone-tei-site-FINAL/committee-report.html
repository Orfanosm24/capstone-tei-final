<h1>Committee Report Investigating Doctor Robert Knox</h1>
<p>This is the committee report that Knox uses to prove the veracity of the court’s decision to declare him innocent, and therefore not guilty of any complicity in the Burke and Hare murders. In the original newspaper publication, it is published alongside Knox’s letter to the editor of the Caledonian Mercury, edited here.</p>

        <p class="committee-opener" style="font-size: 22px;"> <span id="r01">Report of the Committee</span><a class="link_ref" href="#n01" title="Most if not everyone was aware that the lay committee which had decided Knoxs innocence was not adequate or just the evidence t...">¹</a> </p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">The Committee who, at the request of Dr.Knox, undertook to investigate the truth or
                falsehood of the rumours in circulation regarding him, have gone into an extensive
                examination of evidence, in the course of which they have courted information from
                every quarter. They have been readily furnished with all which they required from
                Dr.Knox himself; and though they have failed in some attempts to procure evidence,
                they have in most quarters succeeded in obtaining it, and especially from those persons
                who have been represented to them as having spoken the most confidently in support
                of these rumours ; and they have unanimously agreed on the following report :--</p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">1. The Committee have seen no evidence that Dr. Knox or his assistants knew that murder
                was committed in procuring any of the subjects brought to his rooms, and the Committee
                firmly believe that they did not.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">2. On the question whether any suspicion of murder at any time existed in Dr.Knox’s
                mind, the Committee would observe that there were certainly several circumstances
                (already known to the public), regarding some of the subjects brought by Burke and
                Hare, which, now that the truth has come out, appear calculated to excite that suspicion,
                particularly the very early period after death at which they were brought to the rooms,
                and the absence of external marks of disease, together with the opinion previously
                expressed by Dr. Knox, in common with most other anatomists, of the generally abandoned
                character of persons engaged in this traffic. But, on the other hand, the Committee,
                after much anxious inquiry, have found no evidence of their actually having excited
                it in the mind of Dr.Knox, or of any other of the individuals who saw the bodies of
                these unfortunate persons prior to the apprehension of Burke.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">The bodies do not appear in any instance to have borne any external marks by which
                it could have been known whether they had died by violence or suddenly from natural
                causes, or from diseases of short duration; and the mode of protracted anatomical
                dissection practised in this and other similar establishments, is such as would have
                made it very difficult to ascertain the causes of death, even if special inquiry had
                been instituted with that intention. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">No evidence whatever has come before the Committee that any suspicion of murder was
                expressed to Dr.Knox by any one, either of his assistants or of his very numerous
                class (amounting upwards of 400 students), or other persons who were in the practice
                of frequently visiting his rooms ; and there are several circumstances in his conduct,
                particularly the complete publicity with which his establishment was managed, and
                his anxiety to lay each subject before the students as soon as possible after its
                reception, which seem to the Committee strongly to indicate that he had no suspicion
                of the atrocious means by which they had been procured.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">It has also been proved to the satisfaction of the Committee, that no mutilation or
                disfigurement of any kind was ever practised with a view to conceal the features,
                or abstract unseasonably any part of the body, the presence of which might have facilitated
                detection ; and it appears clearly that the subjects brought by Burke and Hare were
                dissected in the same protracted manner as those procured from any other quarter.<a id="r02" class="link_ref" href="#n02" title="To the contrary there were numerous of signs of his and his staffs active complicity and indiscretion. Burke said in his offici...">²</a></p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">3. The Committee have thought it proper to inquire further, whether there was anything
                faulty or negligent in the regulations under which subjects were received into Dr.Knox’s
                rooms, which gave or might give a peculiar facility to the disposal of the bodies
                obtained by these crimes ; and on this point they think it their duty to state their
                opinion fully.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">It appears in evidence, that Dr. Knox had formed and expressed the opinion, long prior
                to any dealings with Burke and Hare, that a considerable supply of subjects for anatomical
                purposes might be procured by purchase, and without any crime, from the relations
                or connections of deceased persons in the lowest ranks of society. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">In forming this opinion, whether mistaken or not, the Committee cannot consider Dr.
                Knox to have been culpable. They believe there is nothing contrary to the law of the
                land in procuring subjects for dissection in that way ; and they know that the opinion
                which Dr.Knox had formed on this point, though never acted on to any extent in this
                country, has been avowed by others of the highest character in the profession. But
                they think that Dr. Knox acted on this opinion in a very incautious manner. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">This preconceived opinion seems to have led him to give a ready ear to the plausible
                stories of Burke, who appears from all the evidence before the Committee to have conducted
                himself with great address and appearance of honesty, as well in his conversation
                with Dr.Knox, as in his more frequent intercourse with his assistants ; and always
                to have represented himself as engaged in negotiations of that description, and occasionally
                to have asked and obtained money in advance to enable him and his associate to conclude
                bargains. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">Unfortunately also Dr.Knox had been led, apparently in consequence of the extent and
                variety of his avocations, to entrust the dealings with persons supplying subjects,
                and the reception of the subjects brought, to his assistants (seven in number) and
                to his doorkeeper indiscriminately. It appears also that he directed or allowed these
                dealings to be conducted on the understanding (common to him with some other anatomists)
                that it would only tend to diminish or delivery the supply of subjects to make any
                particular inquiry of the persons bringing them as to the place and mode of obtaining
                them. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">In these respects the Committee consider the practice which was then adopted in Dr.Knox’s
                rooms (whatever be the usage in this or other establishments in regard to subjects
                obtained in the ordinary way) to have been very improper in the case of persons bringing
                bodies which had not been interred. They think that the notoriously bad character
                of persons who generally engage in in any such traffic, in addition to the novelty
                and particular nature of the system on which these men professed to be acting, undoubtedly
                demanded greater vigilance. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">The extent, therefore, to which (judging from the evidence which they have been able
                to procure) the Committee think that Dr.Knox can be blamed on account of transactions
                with Burke and Hare is, that by this laxity of the regulations under which bodies
                were received into his rooms, he unintentionally gave a degree of facility to the
                disposal of the victims of their crimes, which under better regulations would not
                have existed<a id="r03" class="link_ref" href="#n03" title="The committees prescient observation here signals the way in which Knoxs involvement in the Burke and Hare murders would become...">³</a>, and which is doubtless matter of deep and lasting regret, not only to himself, but
                to all who have reflected on the importance and are therefore interested in the prosecution
                of the study of anatomy. But while they point out this circumstance as the only ground
                of censure which they can perhaps discover in the conduct of Dr.Knox, it is fair to
                observe that perhaps the recent disclosures have made it appear reprehensible to many
                who would not otherwise have adverted to its possible consequences.</p>

<h2>Editorial Notes</h2>    
<p><span id="n01"><span class="noteLabel">Note 1: </span></span>Most if not everyone was aware that the lay committee which had decided Knox’s innocence
          was not adequate or just; the evidence they used to justify their decision was never
          once made public. An official inquiry and assessment of the facts of this case had
          been expected, but never came to pass (Richardson 137). <a href="#r01">&#11152;</a></p>
<p><span id="n02"><span class="noteLabel">Note 2: </span></span>To the contrary, there were numerous of signs of his and his staff’s active complicity
          and indiscretion. Burke said in his official confession that “Knox was present on
          two occasions when Burke and Hare delivered murdered bodies, and that in one case
          he had approved of a corpse’s freshness, but asked no questions” (Richardson 135).
          Several bodies brought to Knox were delivered with “blood at the mouth, nose or ears.”
          Daft Jamie’s head and feet were cut off in a likely attempt to prevent people from
          recognizing such a public figure in the dissection room, suggesting Knox was seeking
          to avoid accusations of foul play (136). Knox instructed his own staff to receive
          bodies without asking any questions.<a href="#r02">&#11152;</a></p>
<p><span id="n03"><span class="noteLabel">Note 3: </span></span>The committee's prescient observation here signals the way in which Knox's involvement
          in the Burke and Hare murders would become a central justification for passing the
          Anatomy Act of 1832. In order to maintain the status quo of corpse commodification
          necessary to support surgical science and avoid any more legal liabilities, this law
          would allow any dead bodies found in workhouses (and a number of other locations largely
          populated by the poor) that were not claimed within 48 hours to be subject to medical
          experimentation. Following this legislation was a protracted increase in the burning
          of any buildings housing practising surgeons.<a href="#r03">&#11152;</a></p>
<p><span id="n04"><span class="noteLabel">Note 4: </span>In Henry Lonsdale's collection of Knox's writings, his depiction of the letter and
          committee report do not exactly match what was published in the Calidonian Mercury
          newspaper. Lonsdale omits the phrase "For the information of our country readers,
          we may add the designations of" before the names of the people in the committee are
          listed. This is a significant choice and change, as there are many tonal indicators
          that both the writers at the Calidonian Mercury and much of the audience who read
          the newspaper were not of any inclination to believe Knox's attempts to shake off
          culpability (not the least of which being published on the final page of the issue).
          In the newspaper, the implication is that the people reading should know how illegitimate
          those passing judgment were, in Lonsdale's depiction it seems as though Knox or Lonsdale
          offered the clarification of who comprised the committee as an attempt at transparency
          (Lonsdale 88).<a href="#r04">&#11152;</a></p>
